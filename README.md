I worked on a web application that involved user registration and address details. The application allowed users to create an account by providing their email address. During the registration process, the application checked if the provided email was already registered in the system. If the email was already registered, the submit button disappeared, indicating that the email was not available for registration.

Once the user successfully registered their account, they were prompted to select their country from a dropdown menu. After selecting the country, another dropdown menu appeared, allowing them to choose their city as part of their address details.

The web application provided a seamless user experience by ensuring unique email registrations and simplifying the address selection process through intuitive dropdown menus.
